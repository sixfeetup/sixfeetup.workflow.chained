sixfeetup.workflow.chained Information
====================================================
If you use chained workflows, sixfeetup.workflow.chained allows
you to view (and style) each of the chained workflow titles in
the Action Items sub menu. Plone's built-in display only shows
a single workflow state on a piece of content, even if you have
chained workflows. sixfeetup.workflow.chained displays all of
the active workflow states on a piece of content, plus it allows
you to to use CSS to override the style of each individual state
in the displayed list.


How to set up `sixfeetup.workflow.chained`:
====================================================
Add these slugs to your `configure.zcml` under [instance]
(Six Feet Up: prefix with 'base-eggs' and 'base-zcml'):

  eggs =
      sixfeetup.workflow.chained

  zcml =
      sixfeetup.workflow.chained
      sixfeetup.workflow.chained-overrides

  # Six Feet Up only egg server:
  find-links =
      http://${buildout:skillet-login}@skillet.sixfeetup.com/sixfeetup.workflow.chained


What `sixfeetup.workflow.chained` is doing:
====================================================
Overrides the `WorkflowSubMenuItem` class from plone.app.content.contentmenu
Specifically, the `_currentStateTitle` and `extra` functions, returning a
formattted list of items for the workflow content menu.

`contentmenu.pt` is overridden from `plone.app.contentmenu`, allowing
the menu items to display correctly.



Dependencies:
====================================================
If you are using buildout, sixfeetup.workflow.chained will automagically
install `z3c.jbot`.


sixfeetup.workflow.chained Installation (the default info added by paste/ZopeSkel)
====================================================

To install sixfeetup.workflow.chained into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:

 * When you're reading this you have probably already run 
   ``easy_install sixfeetup.workflow.chained``. Find out how to install setuptools
   (and EasyInstall) here:
   http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

 * Create a file called ``sixfeetup.workflow.chained-configure.zcml`` in the
   ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
   should only contain this::

       <include package="sixfeetup.chained" />


Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

 * Add ``sixfeetup.workflow.chained`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:
 
    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        sixfeetup.workflow.chained
        
  * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:
  
    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        sixfeetup.workflow.chained
        
  * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:
  
    $ ./bin/buildout
        
You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.
